# Animal-Segmentation
Our task is to perform semantic segmentation on images of cats and dogs. We are given three classes in the mask (background, border and animal). For accomplishing the task we have used a u-net architeture with some tweakings that were absent in the original paper of 2015. Additionally we have used tf.data for data preprocessing.
